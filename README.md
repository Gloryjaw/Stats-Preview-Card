### What I learned

I learned to use mix-blend-mode to give dark color to image  

    img {
      width: 100%;
      border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
      height: 100%;
      display: block;
      mix-blend-mode:multiply;
      

    }
    .img{
      background-color:  hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    }
##.img is parent of img tag
